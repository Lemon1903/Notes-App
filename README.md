# Notes App using React and Tailwind

A simple notes app built using React, Tailwind, and Vite. I built this to practice my knowledge on React such as components, props, hooks, and event handlers. Overall, a fun experience, learned a lot, and honed my knowledge and experience with React even more!

## Features:

- Basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality
- Add note to favorite
- Filtering notes with search input
- Change the background color of each note
